## How to run this code?

1. install needed JS packages 
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
    (this command will install needed packages from `"devDependencies"` and `"dependencies"` tags in the `package.json` file)

2. build the JS code
    ``` bash
    $ npm run build
    ```
    This command will build code in the **./src** folder and create a built file(`main.js`) in **./dist** folder

3. open **./dist/index.html** on your browser (e.g. Chrome, Edge, or Safari)
